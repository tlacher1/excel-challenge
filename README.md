# Kick Starter Challenge
## Background
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this week's Challenge, you will organize and analyze a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.

## Solution
Conditional formatting was applied to the "Outcome" and "Percent Funded" columns with different color, depending on whether the associated campaign was successful, failed, canceled, or is currently live. The "Percent Funded" column was created to uncover how much money a campaign made to reach its initial goal.
